This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an array index out-of-bounds error and its solution.  The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs when attempting to access an array element using an index that is greater than or equal to the array's size. This can lead to unpredictable results, program crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
